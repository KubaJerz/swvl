here we test building out the model from:

we plan to use this model architecture for your camera 

The model architecture was built semi-correctly, but to properly do this, we need to return our results differently than we do now.
We learned later on in the project that the approach here is wrong â€” both the loss function and the model outputs need to be improved.
